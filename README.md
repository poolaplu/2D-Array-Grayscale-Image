# 2D-Array-Grayscale-Image

This program converts a  Grayscale Image, in the form of a 2d array, from integer grayscale into its double precision float representation. Each element in the array represents a single pixel and is individually converted into their respective double float pixel values.

The 1st and 2nd screenshots of the executed program showcases 2 seperate scenarios where an input can either be manually placed by the user or can be randomly generated by the program itself, provided, that the user inputs the dimensions of the 2d array prior to both of the respective actions. As it can also be seen from the 3rd screenshot, the runtime for the asm segment took 620ns on average and the C segment took 1116ns on average from the 3rd option in the program menu.
